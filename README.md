# java-activespan

This library provides a way to manage an _active span_ within the current process
and propagate it to other threads.

## ActiveSpanManager

The core of this library, this class provides
 1. The `activeSpan()` method to return the _active span_ in the current process.   
    If there is no active span, a `NoopSpan` is returned instead.
 2. Modifications to the _active span_ can be made through the `activate()` and `deactivate()` methods.
 3. Utility `spanAware()` methods to create _span aware_ `Runnable` and `Callable` instances
    that execute with the active span from the scheduling thread.

## ActiveSpanTracer

This `Tracer` makes managing the _active span_ a little easier.
 1. It is a _wrapper_ that forwards all calls to another `Tracer` implementation.
 2. `Span` instances created with this tracer are automatically 
    _activated_ when started and _deactivated_ when finished.
 3. The `SpanBuilder` of this tracer will short-circuit to the `NoopSpanBuilder`, 
    meaning any `NoopSpan` instances will **not** be activated or deactivated automatically.

## SpanAwareExecutorService

This `ExecutorService` wraps an existing threadpool and propagates the _active span_
of the caller into the tasks it executes.  
Convenience variants of the `Executors` JVM factory methods
are provided by the `SpanAwareExecutors` class.

## Custom span managers

It is possible to provide a custom implementation of `ActiveSpanManager`.
This may be useful if you already have a method in place to propagate contextual information
from one thread to another. Creating a custom manager is one way to piggyback the _active span_ on
your existing propagation mechanism. Another way would be to call _activate_ and _deactivate_
at the appropriate moments in your propagation mechanism.  

To enable a custom manager:
 1. Programmatically, call the `ActiveSpanManager.setActiveSpanManager()` with the new implementation.
 2. Using the standard Java `ServiceLoader`, bundle a 
    `META-INF/services/io.opentracing.contrib.activespan.ActiveSpanManager` service file with
    the classname of the implementation.
